# Coinscan
Blockchain Wallet Explorer

This is a MERN stack application that shows transactions for multiple addresses belonging to a wallet.
Using the add address button, you can add the next address to the list of all transactions.
Using the filter you can filter by one day, one week, one month or one year.
Once the data is loaded it is stored in localstorage and so does not have to make requests every time.
Click more to view all details of a certain transaction.
